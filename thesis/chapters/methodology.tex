Drawing upon the research you've conducted; this goal of this chapter is to select and rationalise the research and/or software methods required to meet your project objectives. For example, the choice of quantitative or qualitative methods and the types of statistical or other analysis methods. You should also include software methodologies that are relevant to any development work required to support the projectâ€™s research.

This section will vary greatly depending on your project, and may include sections on topics including (but not limited to) project management, software development methodology, algorithm/model choices, study design, research methods, statistical analysis, performance evaluation, etc. As such, you should discuss the most appropriate approach for developing this section with your supervisor. As this is a Masters-level research project, you must also include a critical discussion on the selected quantitative or qualitative research methods adopted for the project work.

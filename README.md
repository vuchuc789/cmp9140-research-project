# DDoS Detection with Federated Learning

## Data

This project is trained on the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, which can be downloaded from [this website](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html).

> The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset is quite large (roughly 3GB), which exceeds the limit of git-lfs for free accounts (2GB). Therefore, I didn't upload it to this project, and you should download from the offical website.
